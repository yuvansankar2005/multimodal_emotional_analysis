# multimodal_emotional_analysis
üìå Objective:
To detect and analyze emotions using multimodal data‚Äîlikely combining audio, text, or facial cues. This notebook focuses on processing emotional signals using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries:
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

scikit-learn

pandas, numpy

matplotlib / seaborn for visualization

Optional: librosa (audio), transformers (text), or OpenCV (video)

üìÅ Notebook Overview:
Data Loading & Preprocessing

Loads multimodal datasets.

Preprocesses features for different modalities (e.g., text embeddings, MFCCs for audio).

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizes emotion distributions.

Correlation between modalities and labels.

Modeling

Builds and trains machine learning/deep learning models.

Uses architectures such as:

LSTM/GRU for sequential data

CNNs for image/audio feature extraction

Late/early fusion strategies for multimodal learning

Evaluation

Confusion matrices, accuracy, F1-score.

Visualizations of model performance.

Predictions & Insights

Example predictions.

Interpretability methods (e.g., SHAP, attention weights) if used.

üîç Possible Modalities:
Text: Emotion from speech transcripts or sentiment.

Audio: Emotion from voice tone and rhythm.

Visual: (If included) Facial expressions from video.

üöÄ Future Extensions:
Integrate real-time emotion detection (e.g., from webcam/microphone).

Deploy as an API or app.

Add support for more languages or cultural context adaptation.
